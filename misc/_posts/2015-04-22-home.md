Our goal is to understand and predict the impact of mutations. To this end, we develop technology and experiments that precisely quantify the impact of mutations on yeast cell physiology and growth. Yeast cells have a lot in common with human cells but are easier to work with. We pay particular interest to cases where the impact of a mutation changes across genetic or environmental contexts. By shedding light on the effects of mutations, our research provides insights about evolutionary processes and disease.
