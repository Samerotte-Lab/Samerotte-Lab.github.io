Our research moves beyond mapping the effects of mutation and towards understanding of how and why these effects depend on context. We use cutting edge technology in a powerful model organism, budding yeast, to precisely measure how the impacts of thousands of mutations change as the genetic background or environment is systematically varied. This leads to better predictions about the effects of mutation as well as better models about how context dependendence influences evolutionary processes,
