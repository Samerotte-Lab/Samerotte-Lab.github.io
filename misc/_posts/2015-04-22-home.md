Our research moves beyond understanding the effects of mutation and towards understanding how these effects can change depending on context. We use cutting edge technology in budding yeast to precisely measure how the impacts of mutation change as the genetic background or environment is varied. We analyze these data in clever ways that result in mechanistic and predictive models. Our goal is to make better predictions about the effects of mutation and to understand how their context dependendence influences evolution.
