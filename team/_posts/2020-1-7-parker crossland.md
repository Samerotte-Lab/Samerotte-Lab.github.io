Parker Crossland is a PhD student in the Molecular and Cellular Biology program at Arizona State University. She previously earned her Bachelor’s and 4+1 Master’s degrees in Molecular and Cellular Biology at ASU, where she developed a strong foundation in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology. Parker’s current research in the Geiler-Samerotte lab focuses on developing SPINgen, a novel single-cell DNA sequencing platform that combines intracellular genome amplification with split-pool combinatorial barcoding. Her work aims to enable high-throughput genotyping of diverse microbial cells without the need for physical isolation. By pairing SPINgen with experimental evolution, Parker is uncovering new ways to track lineage dynamics and explore genome variation in microbial populations at unprecedented resolution.

Outside the lab, Parker enjoys going to hot yoga classes, hiking, and spending time with friends.
