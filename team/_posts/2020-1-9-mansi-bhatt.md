Mansi Bhatt is a senior at Arizona State University majoring in Biomedical Sciences. As an undergraduate researcher and thesis student in the KGS lab, she is exploring how yeast cell fitness shifts across different evolutionary pressures, ranging from varying temperatures and salt concentrations to the presence or absence of drug treatments. Her work contributes to understanding how environmental factors influence cellular adaptation and selection over time.

Driven by a deep curiosity for genetics and molecular biology, Mansi aims to pursue a research career in cancer genetics, particularly focusing on hereditary mutations and their role in disease development.

When sheâ€™s not in the lab, Mansi enjoys nurturing her plants, experimenting with vegetarian recipes, diving into Vedic astrology, and researching cryptocurrency trends.
