Sam Apodaca was a technician in the KGS lab. Previously, he was an undergraduate student in the school of Molecular Sciences at Arizona State University. In the KGS lab, he studies the evolution of drug resistance using barcoded yeast lineages. These allow him to capture not only the best mutations that underlie resistance, but the entire spectrum of possible mutations that might contribute. This type of comprehensive examination will help us better understand whether the mutations that cause drug resistance come with similar tradeoffs that can be exploited to treat infectious disease. Sam completed his honors thesis studying microbial evolution in 2021, entitled: "Quantifying the Evolution of Fluconazole Resistance in S. Cerevisiae Using Molecular Barcodes"
