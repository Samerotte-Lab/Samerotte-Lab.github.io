Dr. Yuichi Eguchi is a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Mechanisms of Evolution at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University. He is very interested in understanding why protein misfolding harms cells ultimately causing age-related multifactorial diseases. Ichi possesses extensive knowledge of the toxicity of proteins. As a doctoral student, he published a first author paper in eLife describing his systematic analysis of the toxicity of overexpressed proteins and the mechanisms behind their toxicity2.
