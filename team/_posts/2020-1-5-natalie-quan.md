Natalie is a Microbiology PhD student, working on developing the Intra-FCY1 system in budding yeast to study the toxic effects of protein misfolding. She earned her B.S. in Biological Sciences at ASU in 2021, during which she worked on the Paramecium Spatial Proteome project in Dr. Mike Lynchâ€™s lab. She also participated in the Helios Scholars internship at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, where she studied gene fusions that cause primary adenocarcinoma in dogs. Natalie joined the KGS Lab in Fall 2021 and her current research goal is to show how the harmful effects of protein misfolding scales as misfolding increases in severity. 
Whenever she needs to escape science, Natalie is either making way too much Vietnamese food with her family at their farm in Willcox AZ, or burning it off by mountain biking at Chiricahua National Monument.
