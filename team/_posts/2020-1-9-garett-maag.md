Garett Maag is a 4+1 Master's student in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University. He is interested in combating drug resistance using evolutionary medicine. His research in the KGS lab focuses on examining whether mutations that provide resistance to one drug often come with tradeoffs in another drug. Garett is developing high throughput approaches to address this question.
