Mohammad Donyavi is a PhD student in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University. Mohammad works at the intersection of computational and molecular Biology. He earned his B.Sc. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Isfahan in Iran in 2022, where he first got hooked on computational approaches to biological questions.

After joining the KGS Lab in 2023, Mohammad began working on machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict the effects of mutations at the phenotypic level and uncover genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction patterns. He's especially interested in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and how gene regulatory networks get rewired at the single-cell level in response to changing drug concentrations and combinations to explore and uncover the molecular mechanisms of collateral sensitivity and resistance.

Overall, Mohammad aims to bridge biology and computation to better understand how cells respond to genetic and environmental changes.

When he's not in the lab, Mohammad enjoys hanging out with friends, playing board games, hiking, and cooking Persian food.
