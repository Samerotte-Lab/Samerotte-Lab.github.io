Rachel Eder is a PhD student in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University. She is interested in neurological disease and studies the effects of misfolded proteins on a model eukaryotic cell: budding yeast. Her research question is focused on whether misfolded proteins harm all yeast cells equally, or whether certain cells, e.g., older cells, are more sensitive to their effects.
