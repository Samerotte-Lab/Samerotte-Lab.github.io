Quantifying the myriad phenotypic impacts of genetic change at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, and doing so over and over in many different contexts requires <b>incredibly high-throughput phenotyping technologies</b>. We are developing several, having thus far filed 3 patents, all of which list multiple lab members as inventors. Some of the methods we are developing pertain to new single-cell sequencing technology that allows combining DNA and RNA sequencing of the same cell. Other methods involve precisely quantifying the stability of thousands of protein variants at the same time.

We also implement, modify, and rigorously test technologies created by other labs. For example, we have modified an inexpensive and highly multiplexable single-cell RNA sequencing platform for yeasts. We've also performed 79 technical replicates of a method to measure organismal fitness in order to determine how to achieve higher precision. <b>We care a lot about reproducibility in science</b>, so we share the things we learn through <b>[open science campaigns on twitter](https://twitter.com/KSamerotte/status/939247482281738240?s=20&t=x72zyMKP1XE0r05rdQeN0g)</b>, preprints, and special issues on best practices.
