Strategies in evolutionary medicine aim to <b>thwart the evolution of drug resistance</b> by using combinations of drugs that demonstrate “collateral sensitivity,” which is when mutants that resist Drug ‘A’ increase susceptibility to Drug ‘B’. Problematically, it often turns out that resistance and susceptibility are not inextricably linked, and some rare mutations exist that can disrupt these phenotypic correlations. Most technologies cannot quantify the <b>prevalence of collateral sensitivity</b>. We utilize a laboratory evolution platform that is perfect for doing so in the model organism <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Rather than identifying the most resistant mutants in Drug ‘A’, this platform utilizes hundreds of thousands of <b>barcoded lineages</b> to explore virtually all possible mutations that resist Drug ‘A’. Then we quantify their resistance to Drug ‘B’ (and C, D, E...you get the idea). Characterizing these tradeoffs reveals trends and limits that define a <b>fitness landscape</b>. These landscapes can have multiple peaks, corresponding to multiple ways to resist a drug that may come with different tradeoffs (e.g., some may come with or without collateral sensitivity). By creating these types of <b>abstract genotype-phenotype maps</b>, we can make predictions about how organisms will evolve when exposed to new conditions.
