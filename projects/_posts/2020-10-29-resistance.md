Strategies in evolutionary medicine aim to <b>thwart the evolution of drug resistance</b> by using combinations of drugs that demonstrate “collateral sensitivity,” which is when mutants that resist Drug ‘A’ increase susceptibility to Drug ‘B’. Problematically, it often turns out that resistance and susceptibility are not inextricably linked, and some rare mutations exist that can disrupt these phenotypic correlations. Most technologies cannot <b>quantify the prevalence of collateral sensitivity</b>. We utilize a laboratory evolution platform that is perfect for doing so in the model organism <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Rather than identifying the most resistant mutants in Drug ‘A’, this platform utilizes thousands of barcoded lineages to explore all mutations that resist Drug ‘A’. Then we quantify their resistance to Drug ‘B’ (and C, D, E...you get the idea). We use these complex data to <b>create abstract genotype-phenotype maps</b>, that allow predictions about how organisms will perform when exposed to new conditions.
